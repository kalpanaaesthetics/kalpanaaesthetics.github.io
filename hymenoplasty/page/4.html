The scar is caused by abnormal healing and cutaneous irritation. Scarring is more common in severe acne, but it can happen in any kind of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are characterised based on whether an aberrant healing response to skin inflammation results in excessive collagen deposition or loss at the acne lesion's location. Dr Vishal Purohit treats acne Scars with Dermabrasion, dermal fillers, microneedling, subscision, and fat grafting etc.",
          "disambiguatingDescription": "Acne scars are caused by dermal irritation and are estimated to impact 95% of acne vulgaris sufferers. The scar is generated by cutaneous irritation and irregular healing. Scarring is more prevalent in severe acne, but any type of acne vulgaris can cause it. Acne scars are classified according to whether or not an abnormal healing response to skin inflammation resulting in excessive collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesion. Dr. Vishal Purohit uses dermabrasion, dermal fillers, microneedling, subcision, and fat grafting to treat acne scars.",

Finally, the fat is reinjected in small droplets throughout the subcutaneous tissue of the recipient area.",
